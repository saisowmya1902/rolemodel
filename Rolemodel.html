    Mother Teresa founded Missionaries of Charity, a religious congregation, which grew to have over <u>4,500</u> nuns across 133 countries as of 2012.<sup>[6]</sup> The congregation manages homes for people who are dying of HIV/AIDS, leprosy, and tuberculosis. The congregation also runs soup kitchens, dispensaries, mobile clinics, children's and family counselling programmes, as well as orphanages and schools. Members take vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience and also profess a fourth vow: to give "wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor."<sup>[7]</sup>

    Mother Teresa received several honours, including the  1962 Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize and the 1979 <mark> Nobel Peace Prize</mark> A controversial figure during her life and after her death, Mother Teresa was admired by many for her charitable work, but was criticised for her views on abortion and contraception, as well as the poor conditions in her houses for the dying. Her authorised biography, written by Navin Chawla, was published in 1992, and she has been the subject of many other works. On 6 September 2017, Mother Teresa and Saint Francis Xavier were named co-patrons of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta.</p>

    <h2>Biography</h2><hr>
    <p><b>Early life</b></p>
    <p>Mother Teresa's given name was Anjezë Gonxhe (or Gonxha)<sup>[8]</sup>[page needed] Bojaxhiu (Anjezë is a cognate of Agnes; Gonxhe means "flower bud" in Albanian).<sup>[9] </sup>She was born on 26 August 1910 into a Kosovar Albanian family<sup>[10][11][12]</sup> in Skopje, Ottoman Empire (now the capital of North Macedonia).<sup>[13][14] </sup>She was baptised in Skopje the day after her birth.<sup></sup>[8] She later considered 27 August, the day she was baptised, her "true birthday".[13]

        She was the youngest child of Nikollë and Dranafile Bojaxhiu (Bernai).<sup>[15]</sup> Her father, who was involved in Albanian-community politics in Ottoman North Macedonia, died in 1919 when she was eight years old.[13][c] He was born in Prizren (today in Kosovo), however, his family was from Mirdita (present-day Albania).<sup>[16][17]</sup> Her mother may have been from a village near Gjakova,<sup>[18]</sup> believed by her offspring to be Bishtazhin.<sup>[19]</sup>
        
        According to a biography by Joan Graff Clucas, Anjezë was in her early years when she became fascinated by stories of the lives of missionaries and their service in Bengal; by age 12, she was convinced that she should commit herself to religious life.<sup>[20]</sup> Her resolve strengthened on 15 August 1928 as she prayed at the shrine of the Black Madonna of Vitina-Letnice, where she often went on pilgrimages.<sup>[21]</sup>
        
        Anjezë left home in 1928 at age 18 to join the Sisters of Loreto at Loreto Abbey in Rathfarnham, Ireland, to learn English with the intent of becoming a missionary; English was the language of instruction of the Sisters of Loreto in India.<sup> [22]</sup> She saw neither her mother nor her sister again.<sup>[23]</sup> Her family lived in Skopje until 1934, when they moved to Tirana.<sup>[24]</sup> She arrived in India in 1929<sup>[25]</sup> and began her novitiate in Darjeeling, in the lower Himalayas,<sup>[26] </sup>where she learned Bengali and taught at St. Teresa's School near her convent.<sup>[27]</sup> She took her first religious vows on 24 May 1931. She chose to be named after Thérèse de Lisieux, the patron saint of missionaries;<sup>[28][29]</sup> because a nun in the convent had already chosen that name, she opted for its Spanish spelling of Teresa.</p>
